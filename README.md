A collection of websites I've developed, from initial concept/design stages to final delivery and support. The sites were designed in Figma after personal consultation with each client. All were developed using WordPress:

-Gazou Boutique (eShop-https://gazouboutique.gr/)

-Sapranidis (Business Presentation/Online Portfolio-https://sapranidis.gr/)

-Lasari (Business Presentation/Booking, WCAG-compliant website aligned with the technical requirements of an associated government subsidy program-https://lasari.gr/)
